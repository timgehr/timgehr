**Howdy!** 

I'm Tim Gehrsitz. I'm a full stack software developer, currently based in Houston, with a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics from the University of Oklahoma. I love understanding human cognition and our interactions with software from every angle, and completed my master's thesis on the subject.
